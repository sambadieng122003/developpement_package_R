\arguments{
\item{summary_list}{A named list of poverty summary outputs generated by \code{poverty_summary()}.
It must include the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{poverty_measures}, \code{poverty_distribution}, \code{poverty_composition} (data.frames)
\item \code{poverty_measures_plot}, \code{poverty_distribution_plot}, \code{poverty_composition_plot} (ggplot objects)
}}

\item{transfer_results}{A list returned by \code{transfers_summary()}, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{table}: data.frame of results
\item \code{plot_efficiency}: ggplot object of scenario efficiency
}}

\item{inequality_df}{A data.frame of inequality indices returned by \code{inequality_indices()}}

\item{lorenz_plots}{A named list of ggplot Lorenz curves returned by \code{inequality_curve()}}

\item{population}{A ggplot object showing population distribution by group (output of \code{population_distribution()})}

\item{file}{Path to the Excel file to generate (default is "poverty_summary_report.xlsx")}
}
\value{
No return value. A formatted Excel file is written to disk with multiple sheets.
}
\description{
Exports an Excel report that summarizes poverty measures, poverty distribution,
poverty composition, transfer simulation results, inequality indices, Lorenz curves,
and population distribution. The report includes tables and plots in separate sheets,
with an interactive table of contents.
